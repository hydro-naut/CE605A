# CE605A-Probability

This repository contains all my solutions to the python projects for the course CE605A: PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS FOR CIVIL ENGINEERS at IIT Kapur Odd Sem 2020

Following are the questions:

Q1: Monty Hall paradox: Solve the Monty Hall problem by performing MonteCarlo simulations plot the probability of winning for both options for number
    of simulations ranging between 100 and 1000.
    
Q2: Birthday paradox: How many people must be there in a room before there is 50% chance that 2 of them were born on the same day of the year. 
    Assume that there are no leap years, ie. Each year has 365 days, and each day of the years is equally probable for a birthday solve the problem
    using Monte - Carlo simulations and compare the result with analytical solutions.
    
Q3: Before a pipeline for the domestic supply of PNG (piped natural gas) is commissioned it is checked by 3 ultrasonic instruments for any defect. The
    reliabilities of the 3 instruments ie their probabilities of finding defect if present are 0.6,0-7 and 0.8 respectively. Assuming that the results obtained
    from the instruments are independent, what in the probability that any defect in the pipeline will be detected?
